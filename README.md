**University Admission Prediction in Python**
University education is becoming a critical pillar of social and economic life in the twenty-first century. It is crucial not only in the educational process but also in assuring two vital things: a great job and financial stability. Predicting university entrance, on the other hand, might be extremely challenging because pupils are unaware of the admission standards.

So in this tutorial, we will be building our own University Admission Prediction model using Python Programming Language.

Introduction to Dataset
When applying for Masterâ€™s degrees in foreign countries, there are several variables to consider. You must have a decent GRE score, a sop (statement of purpose), or a letter of reference, among other things. If you are not from an English-speaking nation, you need also to submit a TOEFL score.
The dataset includes the following attributes:

1.GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
2.TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
3.University Rating ( out of 5 )
4.Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
5.Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
6.Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
7.Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )
